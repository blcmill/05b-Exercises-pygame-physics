Choose values for gravity, friction, and air_resistance (lines 25â€“27). Try to find a combination that seems realistic

For every line in the update method (lines 41-66), please add a comment describing what it does. 

Try to describe each line within the context of the program as a whole, rather than just mechanically

Feel free to alter the parameters to see how things change. That can be a great way to be able to intuit what is supposed to be happening

I will do a few lines for you as an example
